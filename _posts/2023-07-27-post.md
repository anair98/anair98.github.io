# Our Vision:

Providing appliance retailers an easy-to-use app to manage and view their inventory.

## What is the InvenTracker?

The RTE (Run-Time-Error) InvenTracker is a **comprehensive Inventory Management System** program designed to cater to the **specific needs of e-commerce businesses specializing in appliances**, including dishwashers, washers and dryer machines, and smaller appliances like microwaves.

The system provides tools to **efficiently manage multiple warehouses and multiple categories of appliances**. By offering real-time tracking of **inventory quantity, location, and status**, the application **enables businesses** to make **informed decisions regarding stock management**.

## Who are our targeted users
Our user base would entail a combination of **product managers, warehouse managers, salespeople, and business managers.**

**Salespeople** will only have permission to **view available inventory** and **schedule delivery dates** (as they make sales).

**Warehouse Managers** will have permission to **view analytics** and **schedule the inventory arrival**, in addition to **having all the permissions of a Salesperson**.

**Product Managers** will only have permission to **add new items and product categories**, and **edit existing items and categories**.

**Business Managers** will have full permission to do anything they please. Only **Business Managers** will have permission to **add new users to the app** and **assign them roles and permissions**.

## Feature Overview:

### User Login:
The application provides a secure login system that allows users to access their accounts with designated roles. Two main roles exist: "admin" and "general user." New users have the flexibility to register for the application and choose their role accordingly.

### Admin Privileges:
Administrators have extensive control over the inventory and user management aspects of the application. They possess the capability to modify existing warehouses and categories, ensuring that the inventory organization remains up-to-date and relevant. Additionally, admins can add new users to the system and specify their roles as either general users or fellow administrators. Admins can also add new product model information, which helps in maintaining a comprehensive and accurate inventory catalog. Users are also able to search for products using key words or based on criteria such as warehouse or category of the product.

### General User Capabilities:
General users are granted limited but essential privileges for inventory management. They have the ability to add new inventory items to the system and remove existing ones as necessary, ensuring that the inventory remains updated and reflective of current stock levels. Users are also able to search for products using key words or based on criteria such as warehouse or category of the product.

### General users can also view the inventories within different warehouses and categories, providing them with a clear overview of available stock and its distribution.

Another valuable feature available to general users is the ability to move inventory items between warehouses. This feature ensures efficient stock transfers and distribution, allowing for optimized inventory utilization and reducing the likelihood of stockouts or excess stock in specific locations.

## Our Success Criteria

The success of the RTE InvenTracker will be measured based on the achievement of the following criteria:

* ... **easily view, filter and sort inventory** across any warehouse based on various criteria, such as appliance type or brand name.

* ... **schedule the movement of inventory between warehouses** in just a few clicks.

* ... **effortlessly view available storage space at any warehouse**.

* ... **seamlessly switch between warehouses**, enabling efficient management of individual inventories.

* By meeting these success criteria, the RTE InvenTracker will **empower e-commerce businesses with a powerful and professional inventory management solution** to streamline their supply chain, address inefficiencies, and optimize overall performance.

## Post Mortem and Retrospective:

### Retrospective

Throughout the project timeline, our group demonstrated excellent communication and consistently met the deadlines set during our project planning stages. This cohesion allowed us to progress smoothly and maintain a clear understanding of each team member's responsibilities and progress.

However, we did encounter some challenges during the development process, which provided valuable learning experiences for the team:

**Inexperience with Databases:**
Developing an inventory management system required us to work extensively with databases to efficiently store and retrieve inventory data. Some team members had limited experience with database usage, leading to initial difficulties in designing the database schema and implementing proper data handling. However, we proactively addressed this challenge by conducting research, seeking external resources, and collaborating with more experienced team members to improve our database implementation gradually.

**Challenges with Android Development Tools and GUI Development:**
As our inventory management system targeted the Android platform, some team members faced challenges with Android development tools and graphical user interface (GUI) design. Understanding the intricacies of Android Studio, XML layout files, and ensuring a smooth user experience required time and effort. To overcome this hurdle, we organized internal workshops and shared online tutorials to enhance our knowledge and skills in Android development.

**Ensuring Proper Testing for Each Feature:**
We recognized the importance of thorough testing for each feature after its development, but implementing an effective testing strategy posed its own set of challenges. Striking a balance between writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, while maintaining code coverage, was initially challenging. As a solution, we integrated test-driven development practices into our workflow, which helped us identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

**Understanding Exact Requirements for Proposed Features:**
The inventory management system had multiple proposed features, and ensuring a clear understanding of the exact requirements for each feature was crucial. Miscommunication or vague specifications could lead to discrepancies between our implementation and the stakeholders' expectations. To address this, we conducted frequent meetings with group members, clarified requirements through documentation and mockups, and sought feedback at every milestone with each other to that each feature was on the right track for development.

**Improvements after Iteration 2:**

Since earlier iterations, we have identified significant challenges in our approach. However, in the later stages of the project, we managed to address most issues, and only a few challenges arose during the retrospective after iteration 2. The two main challenges were related to work distribution and starting feature development. Fortunately, we found effective solutions to overcome these obstacles.

To tackle the work distribution challenge, we decided to leverage past iteration contributions as a basis for assigning tasks in the current iteration. By analyzing each team member's past contributions and strengths, we could better allocate tasks according to individual expertise. For instance, we assigned one person to handle generating the website and consolidating final thoughts and ideas for our project.

Regarding starting feature development early, we realized the importance of optimizing our time allocation to ensure timely completion of all project features. Since we knew that the final iteration had limited time before its deadline, we took proactive measures to address this. Specifically, we began working on the next set of features planned for iteration 3 as soon as we submitted iteration 2. This allowed us to maximize our productivity and make progress on the project without wasting time.

By applying these adjustments and learnings from previous iterations, we were able to avoid encountering many errors or significant challenges in later stages of the project. Our improved work distribution and early feature development enabled us to stay on track and deliver a successful inventory management system.

Overall, through continuous improvement and a collaborative effort, we were able to navigate the development process more smoothly and create a refined product that aligned with our project goals.

#### Design Decision


#### Implementing Inferfaces Early On
Implementing interfaces early in the development process was a beneficial strategic decision that allowed for more modularity and abstracion in our code organization. Interfaces also defined formal contracts, promoting collaboration among team members and enabled parallel development. This simplified testing, reduced coupling, and enhanced code flexibility for future changes. By adhering to interfaces, we achieved high level of achieve extensibility and reusability, while also provided effective documentation and facilitated efficient communication among our group members. Overall, this approach set a strong foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and agile approach to our project development this summer. 

#### Utilized Design Principle: 

For Example, 

##### Façade

* Services.get(Class<T>)

Services.get(Class<T>) is a **façade** for all our factory methods used to create our various logic layer services.

The method search for a suitable method defined within itself that returns something assignable to the requested interface, and which takes 0 parameters. It then calls this method to supply the service.

The Services class can be considered as a **facade design pattern** because it provides a simplified interface for accessing various logic manager objects in the application.

This simplifies the client code's interaction with the logic managers by hiding the complexity of object instantiation and configuration.The get() method uses reflection to dynamically locate and invoke the appropriate factory method for the requested manager class.

This approach allowed for flexibility and extensibility, as the get method will never need to change. Simply add a new factory method to have access to a new service.

##### Adapter

* InventoryLogisticsManager

This class acts as a simple wrapper that adapts **InventoryLogisticsDao** to **IInventoryLogisticsManager** so that the UI was not dependent on anything in the Data Access Layer. It encapsulated the lower-level data access details and provided a higher-level interface for the logic layer to interact with.
