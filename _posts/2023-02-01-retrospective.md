## Retrospective

Throughout the project timeline, our group demonstrated excellent communication and consistently met the deadlines set during our project planning stages. This cohesion allowed us to progress smoothly and maintain a clear understanding of each team member's responsibilities and progress.

However, we did encounter some challenges during the development process, which provided valuable learning experiences for the team:

### **Inexperience with Databases:**

- Developing an inventory management system required us to work extensively with databases to efficiently store and retrieve inventory data.
- Some team members had limited experience with database usage, leading to initial difficulties in designing the database schema and implementing proper data handling.
- We proactively addressed this challenge by conducting research, seeking external resources, and collaborating with more experienced team members to improve our database implementation gradually.

### **Challenges with Android Development Tools and GUI Development:**

- As our inventory management system targeted the Android platform, some team members faced challenges with - Android development tools and graphical user interface (GUI) design.
- Understanding the intricacies of Android Studio, XML layout files, and ensuring a smooth user experience required time and effort.
- To overcome this hurdle, we organized internal workshops and shared online tutorials to enhance our knowledge and skills in Android development.

### **Ensuring Proper Testing for Each Feature:**

- We recognized the importance of thorough testing for each feature after its development, but implementing an effective testing strategy posed its own set of challenges.
- Striking a balance between writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, while maintaining code coverage, was initially challenging.
- As a solution, we integrated test-driven development practices into our workflow, which helped us identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

### **Understanding Exact Requirements for Proposed Features:**

- The inventory management system had multiple proposed features, and ensuring a clear understanding of the exact requirements for each feature was crucial.
- Miscommunication or vague specifications could lead to discrepancies between our implementation and the stakeholders' expectations.
- To address this, we conducted frequent meetings with group members, clarified requirements through documentation and mockups, and sought feedback at every milestone with each other to that each feature was on the right track for development.

## **Improvements after Iteration 2:**

- Since earlier iterations, we have identified significant challenges in our approach.
- However, in the later stages of the project, we managed to address most issues, and only a few challenges arose during the retrospective after iteration 2.
- The two main challenges were related to **work distribution** and starting **feature development**.
- Fortunately, we found effective solutions to overcome these obstacles.

### Work Distribution

- To tackle the work distribution challenge, we decided to leverage past iteration contributions as a basis for assigning tasks in the current iteration.
- By analyzing each team member's past contributions and strengths, we could better allocate tasks according to individual expertise.
- For instance, we assigned one person to handle generating the website and consolidating final thoughts and ideas for our project.

### Feature Development

- Regarding starting feature development early, we realized the importance of optimizing our time allocation to ensure timely completion of all project features.
- Since we knew that the final iteration had limited time before its deadline, we took proactive measures to address this.
- Specifically, we began working on the next set of features planned for iteration 3 as soon as we submitted iteration 2.
- This allowed us to maximize our productivity and make progress on the project without wasting time.

### Conclusion

- By applying these adjustments and learnings from previous iterations, we were able to avoid encountering many errors or significant challenges in later stages of the project.
- Our improved work distribution and early feature development enabled us to stay on track and deliver a successful inventory management system.

### Overall

- Overall, through continuous improvement and a collaborative effort, we were able to navigate the development process more smoothly and create a refined product that aligned with our project goals.
